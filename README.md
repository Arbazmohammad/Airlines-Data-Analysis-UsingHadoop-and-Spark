# Big Data Analysis of Airlines Performance Using Hive and Spark:
Hi, Welcome to my Git...

-> This Hadoop project involves Analysing the Airlines datasets and solving few business problem statements to improve the airlines performance.

-> There are multiple ways to solve this problems using various Hadoop Technologies such as HIVE, Spark, PIG, Map Reduce algorithms etc.

-> I have solved these problems using HIVE and PySpark as these are the most popular and widely used technologies in the industries when it comes to analysing Big datasets within Hadoop.


Problem Statements:

A. Find list of Airports operating in the Country India

B. Find the list of Airlines having zero stops

C. List of Airlines operating with code share

D. Which country (or) territory having highest Airports

E. Find the list of Active Airlines in United state

In this use case, there are 3 data sets:

-> Final_airlines, routes.dat, airports_mod.dat
